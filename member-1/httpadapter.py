daemon.httpadapter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module provides a http adapter object to manage and persist 
http settings (headers, bodies). The adapter supports both
raw URL paths and RESTful route definitions, and integrates with
Request and Response objects to handle client-server communication.

    It supports RESTful routing via hooks and integrates with :class:`Request <Request>` 
    and :class:`Response <Response>` objects for full request lifecycle management.
